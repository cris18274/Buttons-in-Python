# Buttons-in-Python
To create buttons in Python, you can use a GUI (Graphical User Interface) library such as Tkinter, PyQt, or wxPython. 

This code will create a button with the label "Click me!" and when it is clicked, the function 'button_click' will be called and the message "Button clicked!" will be printed to the console. You can customize the appearance of the button using different options like 'bg' (background color), 'fg' (foreground color), 'font' (font style), 'height' and 'width' (size), and others.
